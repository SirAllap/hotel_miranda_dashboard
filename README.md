## Project Status

**I am actively working on implementing Redux Toolkit to manage the global state of the TRAVL application. This development phase includes a comprehensive set of features for user interaction:**

- **Manage Rooms:** Effortlessly add, delete, or edit room details.
- **Manage Bookings:** Review all bookings, access guest information, and handle special requests. (Note: Delete functionality is already implemented, and **add** and **edit** features will be added in the near future.)
- **Manage Client Reviews:** View and oversee client reviews, mark them as read, or archive messages.
- **Manage Users:** Seamlessly access and oversee all user (employees) accounts. (Note: Features to update personal information will be added in the near future.) You can assign roles, add new employees, and remove them from the system.

Stay tuned as I continue to enhance TRAVL with even more features and capabilities!
